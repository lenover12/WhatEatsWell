# WhatEatsWell Web Application

WhatEatsWell is a web application that allows users to search for nutrition information about various products and wholefoods. Users can create an account, search for foods, and save their favorite items to their profile. The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing consistent serving size representations and nutrition blocks while omitting unnecessary information.
This application was inspired by the need for a more convenient way to track nutrition information, especially for individuals with dietary requirements such as diabetes. By having quick access to consistent and accurate nutrition data, users can manage their diet more effectively and understand portion sizes and the effects of foods and meals on their body at a glance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) v20.14.0 (LTS) and npm installed on your machine
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) account allowing application's IP access with the database `accounts` and `foods` accessed through a `URI`

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lenover12/WhatEatsWell
cd WhatEatsWell
```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```sh
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   BASE_DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   PORT=404
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   ```

   - `BASE_DB_URI`: Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.
   - `PORT`: The port number the server will run on. Note that this value is currently hardcoded in the frontend.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for JWT authentication.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```sh
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

Note: The `PORT` value in the `.env` file is currently hardcoded in the frontend. If you change it in the `.env` file, you will also need to update it in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
const port = 404;
```

## Running the Application

(development)

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```sh
   cd server
   ```
2. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
3. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../server
   ```
4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

The backend/server tests can be run from the `server` directory. These include unit tests for specific functions using mock MongoDB data, and integration tests for testing the server with a live MongoDB connection.

To run the tests:

```sh
cd server
npx ava
```

## API Documentation

For details on the Open Food Facts API and how it's used in this project, refer to the [Open Food Facts API Documentation](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/files/api-documentation.html).

No authentication is required for READ operations, but you must include a User-Agent HTTP Header with the name of your app, version, system, and a URL (if any) to avoid being blocked.

Example:

```
User-Agent: MyAppsName - Web - Version 1.0 - www.mywebsite.com
```

The search functionality may soon be updated once a stable release of the new API is available. Currently, we are using v1 for search. For more details, see the [Open Food Facts API v2 Documentation](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/ref-v2/#get-/api/v2/search).
